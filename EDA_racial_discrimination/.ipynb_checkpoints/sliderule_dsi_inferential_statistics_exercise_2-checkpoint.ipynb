    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "There is a long-standing debate in the US regarding the existence of racial discrimination in the workforce and its impact on workers. Which is to say, some people believe that white people have an easier time getting hired than non-white people, and other people believe we've mostly moved past race. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to answer this question, researchers responded to 1300 job ads in Chicago and Boston with sets of resumes that were identical, except one resume was assigned a white-sounding name and the other a black-sounding name. Furthermore, each job posting was responded to with a pair of high-quality resumes and a pair of low-quality resumes to see the effects of education and experience. By using names as a proxy for race, and examining which resumes got interview requests, the study was able to give a quantitative measurement on the effect racial discrimination has on the hiring process.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analysis of the study shows that in fact, white-sounding names received a callback rate 9.7% of the time, while black-sounding names received only callbacks 6.4% of the time. This indicates that having a clearly black name reduces ones chances of an interview by nearly 50%. Furthermore, there is only a 0.00005% chance that the difference in callback rates happened by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So on the basis of this study, we can see that racial discrimination has a real and statistically measurable effect on employability. "
